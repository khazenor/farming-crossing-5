# Item Stacks
- Most items will stack up to 100 in your inventory
  - This is mostly for Miles Tickets so they can be easily groups in to groups of 100.  However, the mod I have access to that modify stacksizes (Stackable127) only increases the stack sizes for all items at the same time.

# Visual Tweaks
- All resource packs in the resource pack folder are included by default. This is so that I can enable resource packs I get from curseforge and have the modpack still pass their moderation system.
  - If you don't want this to be the case you can modify the `[resourcepacks]` section in `config\global_data_and_resourcepacks.toml` to not contain `"resourcepacks/"` (make sure to remove the comma from the line above this)
- Minecraft villagers and FarmingForBlockheads market villager are retextured to animals by default. (from the Farming Crossing 4 resource pack)
